    Description: Merge-Purge Demo Run Script Updated for Version 4.1.0
    The Merge Purge Configuration of OYSTER only determines whether references in the input are
    equivalent (referencing the same entity) or not. References are deemed equivalent if they
    match by the rules given in the Attributes Script. The clusters are equivalent references are
    indicated by the Link Output file. Equivalent references are given the same OYSTER identifier.
    The Merge Purge configuration does not maintain identity information, i.e. it does not create
    an Identity Knowledgebase (IKB). It only provides the user with the Link Output which shows 
    which references it determined to be equivalent by the match rules. The link identifiers (OYSTER
    IDs) assigned to the cluster are not persistent.
