The program will evaluate a link output file against a truth set or other reference link output file 
and calculate a number of ER Metrics

You will need Java installed on your computer to run this.  The command is

java -jar er-metrics.jar
-or-
java -jar er-metrics.jar --title=“sample title” <configuration.properties>

If you run the program without specifying a properties file it will look for ERMetrics.properties in the current folder

The parameters in the properties file are as follows.  The indicated values are the defaults.  Parameters in [] are optional

title="Title for this run"
	the title parameter is optional.  It should be quoted if it contains spaces

-- Defined the link file to process
link.filename=Capture.link
	the link file name optionally with a relative or absolute path
link.header=true
	whether the first row of the file contains a column header record
link.delimiter=tab
	The delimiter between columns (tab|comma|period|dash|pipe|space)
link.id.delimiter=period
	The delimiter between columns (tab|comma|period|dash|pipe|space|none)
link.record.columns=1[,n]
	The number (relative to 1) of the reference ID columns
	If two columns are specified the pairs are processed through transitve closure and assigned to clusters
	In this case the link.cluster.column can be 0
link.cluster.column=2
	The number (relative to 1) of the cluster ID column
link.rule.column=3
	The number (relative to 1) of the optional rule column
	Set this to 0 if there is no rule column
link.filter.column=0
	The number (relative to 1) of the column to filter(select) records
	Set this to 0 if there is no filtering
link.filter.value=
	The string or regular expression uses to select records based on the value in link.filter.column
	If the expression returns true the record is included, otherwise it is excluded
link.pair.filename=
	An option file to output the link pairs
	This is useful when in link input is in the form of a pair file without a cluster column.
	The output will contain the two pairs along with the pseudo cluster ID 

-- Define the truth or reference link file
reference.filename=TruthSet.csv
	the referemce file name optionally with a relative or absolute path
reference.truth=true
	the reference file is a truth set
reference.header=true
	whether the first row of the file contains a column header record
reference.delimiter=comma
	The delimiter between columns (tab, comma, or space)
reference.record.columns=1[,n]
	The number (relative to 1) of the reference ID column
	If two columns are specified the pairs are processed through transitve closure and assigned to clusters
	In this case the link.cluster.column can be 0
reference.clusterid.column=2
	The number (relative to 1) of the cluster ID column
reference.filter.column=0
	The number (relative to 1) of the column to filter(select) records
	Set this to 0 if there is no filtering
reference.filter.value=
	The string or regular expression uses to select records based on the value in link.filter.column
	If the expression returns true the record is included, otherwise it is excluded

-- join option
outer.join=false
	false will only consider records in the link file with IDs that match those found in the truth/reference file
	true will consider all the records in the link file
error.limit=30
	Terminate the program after the indicated number of errors

-- False Pair output for reference and research
positive.pair.filename=<filepathname?
	Output false positive pairs to files for research
	If there are large number of pairs this can cause the program to run for a longer
	time because it has to effectively do a sorting closure on references
	If the property is not speciefied or empty no output will be created
negative.pair.filename=<filepathname>
	Output false negative pairs to files for research
	If there are large number of pairs this can cause the program to run for a longer
	time because it has to effectively do a sorting closure on references
	If the property is not speciefied or empty no output will be created
positive.pair.limit=100
	Limit on the number of false positive pairs written
	If the value is not speciefied or empty the default is 100 pairs
negative.pair.limit=100
	Limit on the number of false negative pairs written
	If the value is not speciefied or empty the default is 100 pairs
report.results.filename=
	Results are written to this file, if specified, as a key=value pairs
report.history.filename=
	Results are appended to this CSV file with one run per line, prefixed by the run title
	
When the program runs it will read and parse the truth file first.  
Then it reads the link file and matches the refid against the refid in the truth set.
As each file is read, the header record (if included) and the first data records will be displayed for reference
If there are parsing errors a message will be displayed and the program will abort.

The results of the calculations will be displayed on the console.  
This information along with other more detailed information will be to ERMetrics.log in the current directory
